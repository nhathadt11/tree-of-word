A regular expression, specified as a string, must first be compiled into an instance of this class.
The resulting pattern can then be used to create a 
Matcher object that can match arbitrary character sequences against the regular expression.
All of the state involved in performing a match resides in the matcher,
so many matchers can share the same pattern.
